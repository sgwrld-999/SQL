## **Problem Name:** Recyclable and Low Fat Products

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/recyclable-and-low-fat-products/)

### **1. Problem Understanding**

We are given a `Products` table that contains information about different products, including their ID, whether they are low fat, and whether they are recyclable.

**The Rules:**

  * `low_fats` column is 'Y' if the product is low fat, otherwise 'N'.
  * `recyclable` column is 'Y' if the product is recyclable, otherwise 'N'.

**Task:**
Find the `product_id` of all products that are **both** low fat **and** recyclable.

**Example:**
*Input:*
`Products` table:

```
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
```

*Output:*

```
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
```

*Explanation:* Only products with `product_id` 1 and 3 meet both conditions.

### **2. Identifying the SQL Keywords**

This problem is a classic filtering task, which points directly to fundamental SQL clauses:

1.  **`SELECT`**: The problem asks to "**find the ids of products**." This tells us we need to select a specific column (`product_id`).
2.  **`FROM`**: The data we need is located in the `Products` table, so we must specify `FROM Products`.
3.  **`WHERE`**: The problem sets specific criteria ("products that are both low fat and recyclable"). This is a clear signal to use the `WHERE` clause to filter rows.
4.  **`AND`**: The keyword "**both**" (or "**and**") indicates that multiple conditions must be true simultaneously. This requires the `AND` logical operator to connect the conditions in the `WHERE` clause.

-----

### **3. The Core Logic: Filtering with `WHERE` (The "Why")**

The heart of this solution is the `WHERE` clause. It acts as a gatekeeper, examining each row from the table specified in the `FROM` clause one by one.

  * For each row, it evaluates the condition(s) provided.
  * If the overall condition evaluates to **TRUE**, the row is kept and included in the final result set.
  * If the condition evaluates to **FALSE** or **UNKNOWN**, the row is discarded.

In this case, our condition is `low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'`. The `AND` operator ensures that a row is only kept if **both** the `low_fats` column is 'Y' *and* the `recyclable` column is 'Y'.

-----

### **4. Constructing the Query (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **Start with `SELECT`**: We need to return the product IDs.
    `SELECT product_id`
2.  **Specify the table with `FROM`**: The data is in the `Products` table.
    `SELECT product_id FROM Products`
3.  **Add the conditions with `WHERE`**: We need to filter for rows that satisfy two criteria.
    `WHERE low_fats = 'Y'`
4.  **Combine the conditions with `AND`**: Both criteria must be met.
    `WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'`
5.  **Final Query**: Combining these steps gives us the complete solution.
    `SELECT product_id FROM Products WHERE low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';`

-----

### **5. Dry Run Example**

Let's trace the query against the example input table:

| product\_id | low\_fats | recyclable | Condition: `low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y'` | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | 'Y' | 'N' | ('Y' = 'Y') AND ('N' = 'Y') → TRUE AND FALSE | **FALSE** (Discard) |
| **1** | 'Y' | 'Y' | ('Y' = 'Y') AND ('Y' = 'Y') → TRUE AND TRUE | **TRUE** (Keep) |
| **2** | 'N' | 'Y' | ('N' = 'Y') AND ('Y' = 'Y') → FALSE AND TRUE | **FALSE** (Discard) |
| **3** | 'Y' | 'Y' | ('Y' = 'Y') AND ('Y' = 'Y') → TRUE AND TRUE | **TRUE** (Keep) |
| \*\*4. \*\* | 'N' | 'N' | ('N' = 'Y') AND ('N' = 'Y') → FALSE AND FALSE | **FALSE** (Discard) |

The query keeps the rows with `product_id` 1 and 3, producing the correct output.

-----

### **6. SQL Query**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT 
    product_id 
FROM 
    Products 
WHERE 
    low_fats = 'Y' AND recyclable = 'Y';
```

### **7. Key Takeaways**

1.  **The `SELECT-FROM-WHERE` Pattern:** This is the most fundamental and common structure in SQL for retrieving specific data. Mastering it is essential.
2.  **Filtering is Key:** The `WHERE` clause is the primary tool for extracting only the rows that meet your specific criteria from a larger dataset.
3.  **Logical Operators (`AND`, `OR`):** When you have more than one condition, logical operators like `AND` (for requiring all conditions to be true) and `OR` (for requiring at least one condition to be true) are used to build precise filters.

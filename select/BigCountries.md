### **Problem Name: Big Countries**

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/big-countries/)

### **1. Problem Understanding** 

We are given a `World` table containing geographical and demographic data for various countries.

**Task:**
Identify all the "big" countries. A country is defined as big if either of the following is true:

  * Its **area** is at least 3,000,000 kmÂ².
  * Its **population** is at least 25,000,000.

The final output should include the `name`, `population`, and `area` of these countries.

### **2. The Core Logic: Combining Conditions with `OR`**

The key to this problem lies in understanding the word "**or**" in the problem description. We need to find countries that satisfy the area condition, the population condition, or both. This directly translates to the `OR` logical operator in SQL.

  * The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on a condition.
  * The `OR` operator combines two sub-conditions. The overall condition is **`TRUE`** if **at least one** of the sub-conditions is true.

If we had used the `AND` operator instead, we would have found only the countries that are big in *both* area *and* population, which is not what the problem asks for.

### **3. Constructing the Query (Step-by-Step)**

1.  **`SELECT name, population, area`**: First, we specify the exact columns we want to see in our final result.
2.  **`FROM World`**: Next, we identify the source table for our data.
3.  **`WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000`**: Finally, we apply our filter. This clause tells the database to check each row and keep it only if its `area` is greater than or equal to 3 million **OR** its `population` is greater than or equal to 25 million.

### **4. Dry Run Example**

Let's trace the logic on a small sample of data.
**Condition:** `area >= 3,000,000 OR population >= 25,000,000`

| name | area | population | `area` is big? | `population` is big? | `OR` Result | Keep/Discard |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Vatican** | 0.44 | 800 | FALSE | FALSE | **FALSE** | **Discard** |
| **Brazil** | 8,515,767 | 212,559,417 | TRUE | TRUE | **TRUE** | **Keep** |
| **Algeria** | 2,381,741 | 43,851,044 | FALSE | TRUE | **TRUE** | **Keep** |
| **Australia** | 7,692,024 | 25,499,884 | TRUE | TRUE | **TRUE** | **Keep** |

The query correctly keeps Brazil, Algeria, and Australia because each meets at least one of the conditions.

### **5. SQL Query**

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT
    name, population, area
FROM
    World
WHERE
    area >= 3000000 OR population >= 25000000;
```

### **6. Key Takeaways** 

  * **`OR` for Flexibility**: Use the `OR` operator when you need to select rows that satisfy any one of multiple criteria.
  * **`AND` for Strictness**: Use the `AND` operator when you need to select rows that satisfy *all* specified criteria simultaneously.
  * **Read Carefully**: The choice between `AND` and `OR` is one of the most common decision points in writing SQL queries and depends entirely on a careful reading of the problem's requirements.
